### Before You Begin

* Eat-Da-Burger! is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of ~burgers~ cakes they'd like to eat.

* Whenever a user submits a burger name, your app will display the burger on the left side of the page waiting to be devoured.

* Each burger in the waiting area also has an ~`Devour it!`~ `Eat Me` button. When the user clicks it, the burger cake will move to the right side of the page.

* Your app will store every burger in a database, whether devoured or not.
